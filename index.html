                <p class="intro__text">
                    During my late adolescence, I went through a serious transformation in my life.
                    This led me to a completely new way of experiencing the world. Since then, I’ve always been eager to seize every possibility to grow that I am given on this Earth.
                    I do believe that the potential of human abilities is unlimited and that everyone can change the world on the condition that he truly wishes for it.

                    My major is Philosophy but I also have a deep interest in science, math, literature, sports, languages, gaming, and, of course, codingzzz!

                    Some of my time is spent volunteering. As an activist of the NGO <a href="https://studfreedom.org/"> “Ukrainian Students for Freedom”</a>, I work as an editorial translator within our blog. There, I am responsible for translating articles from various languages into Ukrainian.

                    Learning languages is my another passion. My mother tongue is Ukrainian and I am fluent in English, German and Hungarian.
